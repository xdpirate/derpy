# Derpy
A collection of more or less useful functions for WoW 3.3.5a (Wrath of the Lich King)


## Passive/automatic functions
- **AutoPurge** -- Allows you to maintain a list of items to be automatically purged from your bags
- **CapShard** -- Caps the amount of Soul Shards you carry to a certain number. When this is on, any excess shards are automatically deleted
- **RepTrack** -- Changes your currently watched faction ("display as bar") whenever you gain reputation
- **RepAnnounce** -- Shows you a notification and plays a non-intrusive sound whenever your standing with a faction changes
- **Innervate Notifier** -- Sends a whisper to the receiving target when you cast Innervate on them
- **SpiderBurrito** -- Notifies nearby players when you are afflicted by Web Wrap
- **Rested Notifier** -- Notifies you when entering or leaving a resting area, showing how much rested XP you've accumulated, if any
- **Party Achievement Notifier** -- Posts a notification about your gained achievements to the party chat, for grouping with guild outsiders
- **Guild Ding Notifier** -- Lets your guild know when you level up!
- **Monster Emote** -- Emphasizes monster emotes such as "Murloc runs away in fear!", by shoving them in your face (displays them in the top error frame)
- **Mage Shields** -- Shows on-screen timers for your Ice Barrier and Mage Shield cooldowns. Supports Glyph of Mana Shield. (Requires Deadly Boss Mods)

All of the passive functions can be toggled in-game.

- **Random Pet** -- Summon a random pet companion with some snazzy random dialogue to go with it
- **Silent Random Pet** -- Summon a random pet companion without the snazzy random dialogue (boring version)
- **Speed** -- Calculates and outputs your current speed. Useful for finding out which speed buffs/effects stack and what the resulting speed is

## Misc
Bug reports, pull requests, and feature requests are welcome!

In my defense, the slogans for the random pet functions are from 2011, when I originally made this addon, and in dire need of updates (and chemotherapy).
